          The Video Game Developers Organization (VGDO) is dedicated to
          empowering aspiring game developers and designers by providing the
          knowledge and tools necessary to bring their creative visions to life.
          Our club covers a wide range of game development disciplines,
          including arts and animations, music and sound production, and coding.
          Through hands-on workshops that explore both well-established and
          emerging software, as well as Art, Music, and Game Jams where members
          engage in friendly competition to create art, music, and games, we
          foster a community of innovation, creativity, and learning. Whether
          you're a beginner or an experienced developer, VGDO is here to support
          your journey in the world of game design.
